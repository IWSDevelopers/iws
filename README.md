### The IntraWeb Services Project

The IWS was initiated in 2011 and development began in 2012. It was designed
to replace the existing backend system for [IAESTE](http://www.iaeste.org/), and at the same time create a
new public API, which others could use.

IWS is designed as a pure JEE6 Application, written in Java7. It has been
tested to run under [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/), [JBoss](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware) & [Glassfish](https://glassfish.java.net/). To build, please check out the
sources and run the Maven build command. Note that only Configuration
files for [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/) has been created, and can be found in the iws-accessories folder.
