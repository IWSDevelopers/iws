<a id="welcome-to-the-iws" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-iws" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the IWS</h3>

<p>IWS, IntraWeb Services, was originally created by Kim Jensen for <a href="www.iaeste.org">IAESTE</a>. But to both ensure a broader exposure for other IAESTE Committees around the world, who would like to interact with it and to add newer features which was not requested by IAESTE, it was published as an Open Source Project in February 2016.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-it-is" class="anchor" href="#what-it-is" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it is</h3>

<p>IWS is the back-end system for the <a href="https://www.iaeste.net/">IAESTE IntraWeb</a>. It is written in Java as a pure JaveEE Project, originally running under Glassfish, but later moved to the Open Source JBoss - <a href="http://wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>. It is build using Maven, and requires Java7 or later. The Source Code is kept at source level 7 to be compatible with the current front-end, which is not published as Open Source.</p>

<h3>
<a id="who-is-this-for" class="anchor" href="#who-is-this-for" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is this for</h3>

<p>It was primarily intended for IAESTE A.s.b.l. But it is made readily available to anyone who wishes to either build their own interaction tools for the IWS or use it as a base for their own systems.</p>

<h3>
<a id="when-will-it-be-released" class="anchor" href="#when-will-it-be-released" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When will it be released</h3>

<p>Currently, the IWS is undergoing a bit of code restructuring to get rid of the old "Proto Type" feel. Loads of things were hacked into it under heavy time constraints, and many things have evolved since it was originally written. To help finalize this part, a mixture of monitoring systems is used, including <a href="https://sonarqube.com/">Sonar</a>, <a href="https://www.codacy.com/app/IWSDevelopers/iws/dashboard">Codacy</a> &amp; <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/iws">Coverity</a>. The goal is that all 3 systems will give a clean report, and that all currently open <a href="https://github.com/IWSDevelopers/iws/milestones/1.2.0%20API%20Updates">issues</a> for version 1.2 is completed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please use the current snapshot and build based on it, the API is almost completely locked and the testing with IW4 has shown that everything works.</p>
