The IntraWeb Services Project

The IWS was initialted in 2011 and development began in 2012.  It was designed
to replace the existing backend system for IAESTE, and at the same time create
a new public API, which others could use.

To build, please check out the sources and go to the iws-parent folder and there
run the Maven build command. IWS is a pure JEE7 Application, but there is only
configuration files created for WildFly, see iws-accessories).
