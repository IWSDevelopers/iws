The IntraWeb Services Project

The IWS was initialted in 2011 and development began in 2012.  It was designed
to replace the existing backend system for IAESTE, and at the same time create
a new public API, which others could use.

To build, please check out the sources and run the Maven build command. IWS is
a pure JEE7 Application, but there is only configuration files created for
WildFly, see iws-accessories).

Please be aware that the code level is set for Java7, as the principal Client
still have problem being upgraded to Java8. However, the code is being build
and is running under Java8.
