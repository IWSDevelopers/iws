  "body": "### Welcome to the IWS\r\nIWS, IntraWeb Services, was originally created by Kim Jensen for [IAESTE](www.iaeste.org). But to both ensure a broader exposure for other IAESTE Committees around the world, who would like to interact with it and to add newer features which was not requested by IAESTE, it was published as an Open Source Project in February 2016.\r\n\r\n### What it is\r\nIWS is the back-end system for the [IAESTE IntraWeb](https://www.iaeste.net/). It is written in Java as a pure JaveEE Project, originally running under Glassfish, but later moved to the Open Source JBoss - [WildFly](http://wildfly.org/). It is build using Maven, and requires Java7 or later. The Source Code is kept at source level 7 to be compatible with the current front-end, which is not published as Open Source.\r\n\r\n### Who is this for\r\nIt was primarily intended for IAESTE A.s.b.l. But it is made readily available to anyone who wishes to either build their own interaction tools for the IWS or use it as a base for their own systems.\r\n\r\n### When will it be released\r\nIAESTE decided in August 2016, to move to a new platform. This means that the primary use of the IWS is no longer relevant. So, for now, further development on the IWS platform is being halted.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you need help or assistance with IWS, please contact [Kim Jensen](mailto:kim@dawn.dk).",
